# Create a Movie Rating App

# Challenge Description
During the next few challenges, your task will be to create a Movie Rating App using Vue.js 3.
In this challenge, weâ€™ll start by rendering a list of movies.

## Requirements
- Define the movies as reactive data.
- Use the Vue.js template syntax to display the movie information.
- Render all the movies with a `v-for` loop.
- Display the name, description, genres, and image of each movie.
- Display the movie rating as stars, with a maximum of 5 stars


## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

>
> ðŸ˜€ The movie list is provided as boilerplate, but feel free to add your favorite one into the list.
